# React + Vite

# About this project
This is a simple website build without any web building experience and it is done in a short time.
So The Webite is simple but it still works.

P.S.
This is my first time building a website.

# Tool's that I use in this project
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - An opinionated frontend build tool. It serves your code via a web server
- [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) - Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
- [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.
